                    <p className="text text-dark">8. PRICE AND PAYMENT</p>
                    <p className="text text-dark">8.1 Where to find the price for the Services. The price of the Services will be the price
                        indicated
                        on our Website. We use our best efforts to ensure that the price of the Services advised to you
                        is
                        correct. However please see full terms for what happens if we discover an error in the price of
                        the
                        Services you order.</p>
                    <p className="text text-dark">8.2 What happens if we got the price wrong. It is always possible that, despite our best efforts,
                        the
                        Services may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices before accepting your order so
                        that, where the correct price at your order date is less than our stated price at your order
                        date,
                        we will charge the lower amount. If the correct price at your order date is higher than the
                        price
                        stated to you, we will contact you for your instructions before we accept your order. If we
                        accept
                        and process your order where a pricing error is obvious and unmistakeable and could reasonably
                        have
                        been recognised by you as a mispricing, we may end the contract and refund you any sums you have
                        paid, unless we have already started providing the Services to you, in which case we may
                        withhold a
                        reasonable amount for the work we have done.</p>
                    <p className="text text-dark">When you must pay and how you must pay. We ONLY accept payments using the options available on
                        our
                        website. You must pay for the Services before we start providing them. You must pay for our
                        Services
                        in advance, in order to gain online access to them.</p>

                        another person if we agree to this in writing.</p>

                        terms.
                        Neither of us will need to get the agreement of any other person in order to end the contract or
                        make any changes to these terms.</p>
                    <p className="text text-dark">11.2 KYC: SIR Global Academy can at any time, at their own decision, ask You to provide a copy of

                        request is called (“KYC Request”). You are aware and accept that You will be asked to provide
                        accepted KYC documents before You can access any rewards shared by SIR Global Academy. If a KYC
                        Request

                        any
                        of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</p>
                    <p className="text text-dark">Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist
                        immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in
                        taking
                        steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not
                        have
                        to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date.</p>
